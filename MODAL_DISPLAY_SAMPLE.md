📖 Full Explanation
Amoxicillin is a penicillin-based antibiotic that kills bacteria by breaking 
down cell walls. Effective against wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative 
bacteria. Treats bacterial infections including ear infections (otitis media), 
throat infections (strep), urinary tract infections, skin infections, and 
respiratory infections. MUST take complete course as prescribed to avoid 
antibiotic resistance and treatment failure. Takes 48-72 hours to show 
improvement. Most effective when taken at consistent intervals. Can cause mild 
side effects like nausea, diarrhea, or rash. Serious allergic reactions 
(anaphylaxis) can occur in penicillin-sensitive patients. Do not share with 
others. Keep all follow-up appointments to ensure infection is fully treated.

**Full Explanation** (Cyan Section)

📖 Full Explanation
Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that dramatically reduces stomach 
acid production. Works by blocking hydrogen-potassium pump in parietal cells 
of stomach. Used for treating acid reflux (GERD), peptic ulcers, erosive 
esophagitis, and reducing acid-related complications with NSAID use. Provides 
lasting relief up to 24 hours with once-daily dosing. Takes 2-3 days to 
achieve full effect; maximum benefit at 1-4 weeks. Allows healing of damaged 
stomach lining. Safe and effective when used as directed. Long-term use 
(>1 year) may increase risk of fractures, B12 deficiency, and hypomagnesemia. 
Should use lowest effective dose for shortest duration. Generally should not 
be used long-term without medical supervision. Requires periodic monitoring 
of magnesium and B12 levels with extended use.
