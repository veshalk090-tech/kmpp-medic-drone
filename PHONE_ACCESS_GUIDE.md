## ❌ **If It Still Doesn't Work**

### Check 1: Same WiFi?
- Phone WiFi SSID = Computer WiFi SSID?
- If no, connect phone to same network

### Check 2: Firewall Blocking Port 3000
**On Windows:**
1. Open "Windows Defender Firewall"
2. Click "Allow an app through firewall"
3. Find "node.exe"
4. Check both "Private" and "Public"
5. Click "OK"

### Check 3: Try IP Address Instead
If hostname doesn't work, try:
```
http://10.101.143.63:3000
```

### Check 4: Refresh Phone Browser
1. Pull down to refresh
2. Or: Tap reload button
3. Or: Close and reopen Chrome

## 🧪 **Test on Computer First**

If phone doesn't work, test on computer:
```
http://kmpp-medic-drone:3000
```

If computer works but phone doesn't = **Firewall issue**
If both fail = **Server issue**

1. **Search**: "Windows Defender Firewall"
2. **Click**: "Allow an app through firewall"
3. **Click**: "Change Settings"
4. **Scroll**: Find "node.exe"
5. **Check**: Both "Private" and "Public"
